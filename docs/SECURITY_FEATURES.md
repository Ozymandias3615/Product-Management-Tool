# Security Features

This document outlines the security measures implemented in Product Compass to protect against common web application vulnerabilities.

## 🛡️ Security Headers

All responses include security headers to prevent common attacks:

- **X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff** - Prevents MIME type sniffing
- **X-Frame-Options: DENY** - Prevents clickjacking attacks
- **X-XSS-Protection: 1; mode=block** - Enables XSS filtering
- **Strict-Transport-Security** - Enforces HTTPS connections

## 🚦 Rate Limiting

Rate limiting is enforced on critical endpoints to prevent abuse:

| Endpoint | Limit | Purpose |
|----------|--------|---------|
| `/api/users/login` | 5 per minute | Prevent brute force attacks |
| `/api/users/register` | 3 per minute | Prevent spam registrations |
| `/api/contact` | 2 per minute | Prevent contact form spam |
| `/api/users/me` (DELETE) | 1 per hour | Prevent accidental deletions |
| `/share/*/verify` | 10 per minute | Prevent password brute force |
| `/api/join/*` | 5 per minute | Prevent invitation abuse |

**Global Limits**: 1000 requests per hour, 100 requests per minute per IP

## 🔐 Authentication & Authorization

- **Session-based authentication** with secure session management
- **Role-based access control** (Owner, Admin, Member, Viewer)
- **Google OAuth integration** with proper token verification
- **Password hashing** using Werkzeug's secure methods
- **Environment-based secret management**

## 📊 Data Protection

- **Environment variables** for all sensitive configuration
- **No hardcoded secrets** in the codebase
- **Secure database connections** with parameterized queries
- **SQLAlchemy ORM** prevents SQL injection attacks
- **Input validation** on all user inputs

## 🔍 Monitoring & Scanning

- **Automated security scanning** via GitHub Actions
- **Dependency vulnerability checking** with Safety
- **Code security analysis** with Bandit
- **Regular security updates** through automated workflows

## 🚨 Error Handling

- **Custom error pages** that don't leak sensitive information
- **Rate limit error handling** with appropriate HTTP status codes
- **Graceful degradation** for security failures
- **Logging** without exposing sensitive data

## 📝 Security Best Practices

### Development
- Never commit secrets or credentials
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Keep dependencies updated
- Follow secure coding practices

### Production
- Set strong `SECRET_KEY` environment variable
- Use HTTPS for all connections
- Configure proper database security
- Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- Use Redis for rate limiting storage (not memory)

## 🔄 Security Updates

Security measures are continuously improved through:

1. **Weekly automated scans** for vulnerabilities
2. **Dependency updates** via Dependabot
3. **Code security reviews** for all changes
4. **Security policy** for vulnerability reporting

## 📞 Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

- Email: security@productcompass.com
- Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting
- Follow our security disclosure policy

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Environment Variables Required

```bash
SECRET_KEY=your-secret-key-here
DATABASE_URL=your-database-url
MAILGUN_API_KEY=your-mailgun-key
# ... other configuration
```

### Production Recommendations

1. Use a strong, randomly generated `SECRET_KEY`
2. Configure Redis for rate limiting: `REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379`
3. Enable HTTPS with proper SSL certificates
4. Set up monitoring and alerting
5. Regular security audits and penetration testing
